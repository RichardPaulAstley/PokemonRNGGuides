Okay so here's an attempt from me to explain how I see things for the Guides part. It's not a surprise, I'm not the best to design dev things etc, but I think that my real pro is to bring the knowledge and to have a vision on how to make the site really optimal for emu / retails users, with the most optical way for us to work on guides. 

I'm gonna make a fast description on how I see things atm / How we should go for the guides :

## The issues 

* The main issue (and i'm the first culprit) is because of outdated guides, the stuff is really oriented emu users. And i feel like it gives a reputation of Pokemonrng.com that is wrong. Not to mention that many of the guides are designed to be emu only but in fact ARE 100% working for any setup. A lot of them should be easily convertible for emu / retail by just slightly editing them.
* We're focusing too much on specific cases, and holding hands too much. Like making a SPECIFIC guide for a specific case is not helpful if you ask me. Every RNG works around a base, than can be common to a high amount of RNGs in game. It's important to show how to learn that to make users more aware of the RNG execution rather than throwing guides.

But it's not my main point

## The Direction I see for guides

It's something I've brought to the table years and years ago already. I want to do a specific structure for the guides for two reasons :

* Creating something unique for Pokemonrng.com. A new way to build guides, to learn and to make users more... Self awareness on how to work / learn things.
* Making easier to separate emus / retail guides and covering a huge amount of them easily
* Avoid to repeat ourself for EVERY guide.
* Easy to maintain and to update. A new tool pops up ? Just edit that guide. No need to come back on EVERY guide to change them. Best example I can give is PokeReader and PCalc. Imagine all the guides we have to rework ONLY to change pcalc to PokeReader mentions while the use and the application is still the same.

So the most important is : How to go for it ? Well here's the way I'd structure the website : 

* Creating **Base Knowledge Guides** I call them guides where you learn the basics. And that way ANY technical RNG can be read and applied because **YOU KNOW THIS**. This is the place where emu / retail guides would be separated.
* Creating **Technical Guides** These guides are more specific for a global method, but would be easy to maintain for any way to RNG. Emu ? Retail ? Same. For example, a stationary guide in gen 3 wouldn't tell you "set up your timer blablabla", no. A Stationary guide would give a list of the Pokemon affected by the method, the delay, the generation process and NOTHING else, because coming to this guide, you know how it works.

Ofc special cases can exist, but the core should be built around this method.

I've applied that to BW2 Egg RNG where I only focus on the Egg part. Now how to use PokeFinder, not how to use Retail / Emu methods. Just straight to the steps. 

The most important would be to create a good structure for that and have the correct vision for that. So having one person to maintain the structure might be critical.

## My concerns with that methods

Even if I find this method effective (for example you can search for an info fast and easily), the main problem might be the direction Pokemonrng.com is following with integrated tools etc.
